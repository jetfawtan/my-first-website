                    <p>My final module project is called Jia Le's Mood lamp. It is a mood lamp with different gradients of blue when the push button is used.<p>
                    <p>In order to complete my mood lamp, I had to first create a sketch for my mood lamp</p>
                    <img src="project1.png"/>
                    <p>For the sketch above,it is for the overall box. I placed two holes at the side as i had intended to place my push button within it and the usb power cable through the other hole.</p>
                    <img src="project2.png"/>
                    <p>For the sketch above, it is for the middle section of the box as i wanted to use it as a divide between the top portion of my box where i would place my led strips and the bottom portion of the box is where i place the arduino board and the breadboard. The hole in the middle section is supposed to allow the led strip to enter the top section of the box. </p>
                    <img src="projectL.png"/>
                    <p>For the sketch above, it is to print out the 3D printed part of my box by adding a letter L to paste it on my box to recognise that it is mine.</p>

                    <p>The second stage was to laser cut the sketch. I used 3mm white acrylic to form the box. Below are images of the box after forming it.</p>

                    <img src="projectbox2.jfif"/>
                    <p>The third stage was to 3D print the L shape. Below is a picture of the file being sliced in the Cura.</p>
                    <img src="CuraL.png">
                    <p>It was quite hard to piece the acrylic pieces together as they would often fall apart.I decided to use super glue such that box does not fall apart after I have pieced it together.</p>
                    <p>The third stage was to program the arduino uno. I programmed the arduino uno such that the led strip will light up according to the different gradiances of blue after pushing the push button. Below is the code that i wrote down which i seeked reference from the internet on moodlamp neopixel codes.</p>

                    <img src="project.mp4"/>
                    <p>However, there seems to be an issue when i try to run the arduino program. This might be due to some error within my code. The video above shows what happens when i try to run the arduino program</p>
